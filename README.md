Okay, here are the steps on how to insert an image into your README.md file in your GitHub repository, referencing the image file name you provided:

Steps:

Upload the image:
First, you need to upload the image inbox_1842206_b984828c354c4d8e72965aa78d5503ee_pinterest2.png to your GitHub repository. You can do this by dragging and dropping the image file into the root directory of your repository or a specific folder within your repository.
Get the image URL:
After uploading the image, you need to get its URL. You can do this by navigating to the image in your repository on GitHub and copying the image URL from your web browser's address bar.
Insert the image in your README.md:
Open your README.md file in a text editor.
Insert the following Markdown code where you want the image to appear, replacing the placeholder URL with the actual URL you obtained in step 2.

Use code with caution
Reasoning:

This approach allows you to link the image directly from your GitHub repository, ensuring it remains accessible as long as the image file is in your repository. The Markdown syntax ![Image Description](Image URL) is the standard way to insert images in README files on GitHub.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
